## Container containing a MPI Application running with Torque scheduling server 
## inside Ubuntu 16.04 and access via ssh to a 'app' user.
## To use as a service, SSH to this container as user app.
## It is suggested to put job scripts in /scratch (that you might
## want to create as a data volume for efficiency
##
## Note! Torque-mom requires that 'ulimit -l unlimited' is set. To achieve
## This, you need to run this container with the '--privileged' option

# Based on image parana/torque which use phusion/baseimage as base image.

# Note also that I use phusion because, as explained on the 
# http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/ page, it automatically
# contains and starts all needed services (like logging), it
# takes care of sending around signals when stopped, etc.
